# COMBS: Convergent motifs for binding sites

This package contains the code used to design the apixaban-binding proteins
described in "A defined structural unit enables de novo design of small-molecule-binding
proteins" by Polizzi and DeGrado.  This code is for archival purposes; a living
version of COMBS will be maintained elsewhere (https://github.com/npolizzi/Combs).
